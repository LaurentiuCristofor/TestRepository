  <p>Creating an ebook using <i>Calibre</i> is a pretty simple process. The most important steps are to plan the chapters of your book, then to create the XHTML files for holding their content. The remainder of the work will consist just of the plain work of editing your content and of updating the Table of Contents and the <i>content.opf</i> file whenever you add new content. And don't forget to also regenerate the logical Table of Contents at the end.</p>
  
  <p>If you need additional information about how to format specific content, you can find many resources on HTML and CSS online. Here are a couple of links to get you started:</p>
